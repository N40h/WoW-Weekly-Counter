# Weekly Keys Counter App

Following the JS course on Scrimba, the first part is a passenger counter app, playing World of Warcraft during this time, i got the idea to reproduce a similar app but for the number of dungeons done for the week on an account.

Just a simple project without much code and complexity but it was fun to do.

Here is the link to the demo : [Demo](https://glittering-clafoutis-ccd969.netlify.app/)
